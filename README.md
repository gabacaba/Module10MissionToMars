# Module10MissionToMars

## Purpose of the Assignment
The purpose of the assingment is to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images. Then, this information will be stored in a Mongo database so that a web application could display the data. Also, we modify the design of the web app to display these images. 
The final result would be a site that contains information about Mars and some images.
